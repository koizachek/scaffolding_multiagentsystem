# Scaffolding System Implementation Summary

## Date: August 25, 2025

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. **Hardcoded Agent Order** ✅
- Location: `MAS/app/streamlit_experimental_session.py` (lines 1089-1111)
- The agent sequence is now hardcoded for all participants:
  1. Conceptual Scaffolding (Round 1)
  2. Procedural Scaffolding (Round 2)
  3. Strategic Scaffolding (Round 3)
  4. Metacognitive Scaffolding (Round 4)
- Round 0 remains as baseline (no scaffolding)

#### 2. **Template-Based Scaffolding Responses** ✅
- Location: `MAS/utils/ai_api.py`
- Modified `generate_scaffolding_response()` method to:
  - Import and use templates from `scaffolding_config.py`
  - Select templates based on scaffolding type and intensity
  - Use `generate_default_prompts()` from `scaffolding_utils.py`
  - Pass selected templates to the AI with instructions to use them as response base
  - Track which templates have been used to avoid repetition

#### 3. **New Method Added** ✅
- Added `_build_scaffolding_prompt_with_template()` method in `ai_api.py`
- This method:
  - Takes a template string as input
  - Builds context from the concept map
  - Instructs the AI to use the template structure
  - Personalizes with actual concepts from the learner's map

#### 4. **Repository Cleanup** ✅
- Removed unnecessary test files:
  - `test_template_selection.py`
  - `test_uuid_fix.py` 
  - `test_imports.py`
  - `app/test_component.py`
  - `TEMPLATE_SELECTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
  - `verify_scaffolding_templates.py`
- Kept legitimate test file:
  - `database/test_mdbservice.py` (unit tests for MongoDB service)

### How the System Works Now

1. **Template Selection**:
   - System checks if it's an initial prompt or follow-up
   - For initial prompts: Uses templates from `SCAFFOLDING_PROMPT_TEMPLATES`
   - For follow-ups: Uses templates from `SCAFFOLDING_FOLLOWUP_TEMPLATES`
   - Tracks used templates to avoid repetition

2. **AI Response Generation**:
   - AI receives the template as part of the prompt
   - Instructed to use template structure but personalize with actual concepts
   - Maintains scaffolding approach defined in templates
   - Templates ensure consistency in experimental conditions

3. **Scaffolding Mechanics**:
   - Templates are the core of the scaffolding evaluation
   - Each scaffolding type has specific templates for different intensities
   - AI adapts templates to the learner's actual concept map
   - Ensures experimental validity by using consistent scaffolding approaches

### Key Files Modified

1. `MAS/utils/ai_api.py`:
   - `generate_scaffolding_response()` - Now uses templates
   - `_build_scaffolding_prompt_with_template()` - New method for template-based prompts

2. `MAS/app/streamlit_experimental_session.py`:
   - `initialize_agent_sequence()` - Hardcoded order (already implemented)

### Verification

The system now:
- ✅ Uses hardcoded agent order for all participants
- ✅ Generates responses based on your scaffolding templates
- ✅ Maintains experimental consistency
- ✅ Tracks template usage to avoid repetition
- ✅ Personalizes templates with actual concept map content

### Important Notes

- The scaffolding templates in `scaffolding_config.py` are now the primary driver of agent responses
- The AI is instructed to maintain the template structure while personalizing with specific concepts
- This ensures experimental validity while still providing contextual responses
- The hardcoded order ensures all participants receive the same sequence of scaffolding types
